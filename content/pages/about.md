After graduating from a Master Degree in Internatioal Law from the University of Ottawa and Aix-Marseille University, she worked as a legal attache in New York for the French Mission at the United Nations.

She lived in many cities around the world, such as Sao Paulo, Lima, New York, San Francisco, Montreal, London, Paris and now Amsterdam. She's an adventure and nature advocate and believe in positive changes.
