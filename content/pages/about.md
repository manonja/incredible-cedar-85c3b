**Manon Jacquin** is a writer, photographer and software engineer based in Amsterdam. She comes from a beach town in the South of France where she loved to go back from time to time to enjoy the sun, the beach, the mountainns, and of course the food! After graduating from a Master Degree in Internatioal Law from the University of Ottawa and Aix-Marseille University, she worked as a legal attache in New York for the French Mission at the United Nations. Drown by her crestivity and curiosity, she learned how to code and became a Software Engineer.

She is passionate about traveling, storytelling, entrepreneurship, lifestyle and holistic healing. She lived in many cities around the world, such as Sao Paulo, Lima, New York, San Francisco, Montreal, London, Paris and now Amsterdam. She's an adventure and nature advocate believing in a more sustainable and healed world. 

But, overall, she does not like to define herself - it always felt counter intuitive. Aren't we constantly evolving, moving and changing? She hopes we all do!
